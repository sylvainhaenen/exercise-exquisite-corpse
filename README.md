# Job Interview
~At the end of August, I absolutely had to find a job starting from September on. After applying to different jobs I finally got a job-interview to work in one of those tea shops "Palais des th√©s". On that day, it was so warm outside that I decided to show up at the interview wearing light clothes, only a short and a t-shirts.
