# Job Interview
~At the end of August, I absolutely had to find a job starting from September on. After applying to different jobs I finally got a job-interview to work in one of those tea shops "Palais des th√©s". On that day, it was so warm outside that I decided to show up at the interview wearing light clothes, only a short and a t-shirts.
<br/> When the interviewer he immmediately asked me why was I dressed like that.
<br/> I was quiet confuse and talled him that the weather outside was wonderful.
<br/> After I asked him ***why was he wearing a coat in summer***..
